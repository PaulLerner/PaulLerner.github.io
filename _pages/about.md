I'm a postdoc researcher at Sorbonne Université, CNRS, ISIR. I got my PhD in Multimodal Information Retrieval at Paris-Saclay University (LISN/CNRS lab). 
I'm currently working on Multilingual Large Language Models and Machine Translation with [François Yvon](https://fyvo.github.io/).
My PhD advisors were [Olivier Ferret](http://oferret.free.fr/) (CEA List) 
and [Camille Guinaudeau](https://sites.google.com/view/camille-guinaudeau/accueil) (LISN). 
Before my PhD, I already worked with Camille but also with [Hervé Bredin](https://herve.niderb.fr/fastpages/),
about Multimodal Speaker Diarization, as a research engineer.

I have an engineering degree in Computer Science from ESILV and a master's degree
in Artificial Intelligence from Paris Descartes University (now Paris Cité).
During these studies, I did two internships: 
one at ISIR/CNRS with [Catherine Pelachaud](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/pelachaud/)
and [Beatrice Biancardi](https://sites.google.com/view/beatricebiancardi) on Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction,
and one at Télécom Paris with [Laurence Likforman-Sulem](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/lauli/)
on Parkinson's Disease detection based on handwriting. 
See [my resume](/files/lerner_CV_EN.pdf) for further details.

I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, with a focus on resources and evaluation.

If you're interested in my research, you can find a [list of my publications here](/publications), and [of my talks there](/talks).
I advised several master students, [learn about them here](/advising).

In 2025, I was awarded the DAAD AINeT fellowship that funded a week of travel to visit German labs.

I like to open source my research code and datasets, find a [list of available resources here](/resources).

I'm also currently Teacher at Aivancity and Teacher Assistant at Sorbonne Université.
During my PhD, I was Teacher Assistant at Paris-Saclay University and Polytech Paris-Saclay. 
During two years of my postdoc, I was Teacher Assistant at ENSAE (IP Paris).
I was also lab monitor at LxMLS 2025.
