I'm currently finishing a PhD about Multimodal Information Retrieval at Paris-Saclay University (LISN/CNRS lab). 
My PhD advisors are [Olivier Ferret](http://oferret.free.fr/) (CEA List) 
and [Camille Guinaudeau](https://sites.google.com/view/camille-guinaudeau/accueil) (LISN). 
Before that, I already worked with Camille but also with [Hervé Bredin](https://herve.niderb.fr/fastpages/),
about Multimodal Speaker Diarization, as a research engineer.

I have an engineering degree in Computer Science from ESILV and a master's degree
in Artificial Intelligence from Paris Descartes University (now Paris Cité).
During these studies, I did two internships: 
one at ISIR/CNRS with [Catherine Pelachaud](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/pelachaud/)
and [Beatrice Biancardi](https://sites.google.com/view/beatricebiancardi) on Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction,
and one at Télécom Paris with [Laurence Likforman-Sulem](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/lauli/)
on Parkinson's Disease detection based on handwriting. 
See [my resume](/files/CV.pdf) for further details.

I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, 
as well as Machine Learning when applied to these fields.
During my PhD, I've focused on:
- data collection and annotation / evaluation of Question Answering systems
- multimodal fusion, representation, and retrieval / how do modalities interact

In the context of Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering about Named Entities.

If you're interested in my research, you can find a [list of my publications here](/publications).

During my PhD, I also was [Teacher Assistant](/teaching) at Paris-Saclay University and Polytech Paris-Saclay.
