I'm a postdoc researcher at Sorbonne Université, CNRS, ISIR. I got my PhD in Multimodal Information Retrieval at Paris-Saclay University (LISN/CNRS lab). 
I'm currently working on Machine Translation with [François Yvon](https://fyvo.github.io/).
My PhD advisors were [Olivier Ferret](http://oferret.free.fr/) (CEA List) 
and [Camille Guinaudeau](https://sites.google.com/view/camille-guinaudeau/accueil) (LISN). 
Before my PhD, I already worked with Camille but also with [Hervé Bredin](https://herve.niderb.fr/fastpages/),
about Multimodal Speaker Diarization, as a research engineer.

I have an engineering degree in Computer Science from ESILV and a master's degree
in Artificial Intelligence from Paris Descartes University (now Paris Cité).
During these studies, I did two internships: 
one at ISIR/CNRS with [Catherine Pelachaud](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/pelachaud/)
and [Beatrice Biancardi](https://sites.google.com/view/beatricebiancardi) on Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction,
and one at Télécom Paris with [Laurence Likforman-Sulem](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/lauli/)
on Parkinson's Disease detection based on handwriting. 
See [my resume](/files/lerner_CV_EN.pdf) for further details.

I'm interested in Multimodal and Multilingual Natural Language Processing (and Information Retrieval), 
with a focus on resources and evaluation.

If you're interested in my research, you can find a [list of my publications here](/publications).

I'm also currently Teacher at Aivancity and Teacher Assistant at ENSAE (IP Paris).
During my PhD, I was Teacher Assistant at Paris-Saclay University and Polytech Paris-Saclay. More about [my teaching activities here](/teaching).
