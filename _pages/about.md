I'm currently finishing a PhD about Multimodal Information Retrieval at Paris-Saclay University (LISN/CNRS lab). 
My PhD advisors are Olivier Ferret (CEA List) and Camille Guinaudeau (LISN). 
Before that, I already worked with Camille but also with Hervé Bredin, about Multimodal Speaker Diarization, as a research engineer.
I have an engineering degree in Computer Science from ESILV and a master's degree
in Artificial Intelligence from Paris Descartes University (now Paris Cité).
During these studies, I did two internships: 
one at ISIR/CNRS with Catherine Pelachaud and Beatrice Biancardi on Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction,
and one at Télécom Paris with Laurence Likforman-Sulem on Parkinson's Disease detection based on handwriting. 
See [my CV](./CV.pdf) for further details.

I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, as well as Machine Learning when applied to these domains.
During my PhD, I've focused on:
- data collection and annotation / evaluation of Question Answering systems
- multimodal fusion, representation, and retrieval / how do modalities interact
In the context of Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering about Named Entities.
